**Project Title** "Yelping to the Rythm"

As part of my first semester at USC, I conducted this study as the final project for a Business Analytics class with 7 other students. In this project, we scraped open-source data and information online (Live Nation, etc) to collect data on mainstream music concerts in Los Angeles from 2014-2017. 

We performed a t-test, linear regression, and multilinear regression analyses to explore the correlation between music concerts and the culinary economy in Los Angeles.
